SLcuda is a NVIDIA CUDA runtime implementation for SLang, for general
purpose programming of NVIDIA GPUs. Extended functionality is broken
into several modules, the main module (cuda-module.cu) is the only one
necessary to manage data on the GPU, kernels can be dynamically
created with functions in cuda.sl. Random number generation is built
into the main module.
